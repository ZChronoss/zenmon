# Zenmon

A way to focus with your favourite Pokemon!

## Feature

* Timer: Focus with your task, timed by your own desire!
* Peer-to-peer connection: connect to your friend (with the same WiFi network) and focus together! This connection is using Peerdart package, built on top of PeerJS, utilizing WebRTC.
* Get randomized Pokemon each time you open Zenmon.

In this days, people are getting distracted easily, and many of them are getting distracted by social media and other distracting apps. Zenmon wants to help you keep focused while enable socializing with your nearest friend at the same time.

## Limitations

* You have to manually ask your friend (within the same WiFi network) for the code for you and your friend to connect.
* For now, you can only run the app for iOS and Android

## How to Run the App

* If you want to try the peer-to-peer feature on your own:
    1. Set up an emulator, run Zenmon on the emulator
    2. Set up a physical device (Android/iOS), run Zenmon on your physical device.
    3. Type/copy the code on emulator/physical device and copy it to the text field available in the other device.

* If you want to setup the timer:
    1. Click the timer to select your desired time.
    2. Hit 'Start Timer'
    3. Hit 'Reset Timer' to stop and reset your timer.

## What Would I do with more Time

I want to create some more features such as:
    1. Connection with QR code
    2. Block apps (you need to enroll Apple Developer Program for this feature in iOS)
    3. Pokemon collection system
